6004,6004,873,52,Not as cute in person,"Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.",2,0,0,General,Tops,Knits

6957,6957,867,35,Not worth the price,"Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.",2,0,2,General Petite,Tops,Knits
6958,6958,928,37,,"Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s, but that would be cutting it, especially since i'm 5ft 11in, 133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.",5,1,0,General,Tops,Sweaters
6959,6959,867,45,Around the clock and in every color,"I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.",5,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Knits
6960,6960,850,46,Beautiful summer shirt; runs very large,"The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.",4,1,4,General,Tops,Blouses
6961,6961,1022,35,,"I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.",5,1,1,General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans

6965,6965,663,45,Cute dress,"Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.",5,1,17,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6966,6966,663,58,Cute tunic,This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee,4,1,1,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6967,6967,663,39,The material is lightweight and comfortable.,The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.,4,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6968,6968,970,47,Super soft but fits boxy and fits small,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,2,0,3,General,Jackets,Jackets
6969,6969,663,34,Good if you're taller,"I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!",2,0,1,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6971,6971,719,25,,"Unfortunately, the other reviews were accurate. i thought i could still make it work because i loved the design. but alas the dress is incredibly see-through. i tried using it like a bathing suit cover up, unbuttoned, like one of the models shows - but it looked very strange. would have definitely kept this dress for the beach if it weren't completely see-through.",4,0,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6972,6972,970,59,,"I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however, the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also, the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.",3,0,0,General,Jackets,Jackets
6973,6973,719,86,Nice summer dress,"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",5,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6974,6974,719,32,Beautiful flowy vacation dress,"The pattern on this dress is even more beautiful in person. as reviewers mention, the dress is sheer, but a nude slip underneath is an easy fix. can't wait to pack this dress for my next beach getaway!",4,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6977,6977,719,55,The jury is still out on this one...,"Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.",4,1,15,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
6978,6978,719,58,So pretty,"This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10"" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium",4,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6982,6982,1022,42,Like butter,"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.",5,1,1,General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans

6984,6984,663,28,Sliced tunic dress,"I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2"", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th",4,1,1,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6986,6986,719,34,Love it more than i thought,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.,5,1,0,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6988,6988,663,62,Great weekend and casual dress,"I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors",5,1,22,Initmates,Intimate,Lounge

6990,6990,13,39,Stylish but strange,"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",4,1,0,General,Dresses,Dresses
