5967,5967,1004,53,Lovely skirt,"I was hesitant to try this on because honestly, it looked so short. however, i just bought this at my retailer store and it is very flattering on! 1st of all, it runs big. my normal size (12) was way too big and i had to go down a size. i could have gone down 2 sizes but the length became problematic. in my regular size (that was too big), the skirt hit me a few inches above my knee. perfect! in the size smaller, it was a tad higher; wish it was the same longer length as the 12 but still acceptabl",4,1,5,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
5968,5968,850,23,Very cute,"The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!",5,1,0,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
